#Builder desing pattern.
# The builder patter arises from the need when we have a base class to be able
# extend its functionalities without having to create a large amount of subclasses while also
# being very flexible in the type of new functionalities that it needs to adquire.

# example  : 

# We have a class . We need to be able to generate different types of houses without having to spawn many subclases 
# for every possible variation of house. House we need an easy way to scale the base class every time we need a new type of house.

# the builder pattern allows to build complex object step by step piece by piece. This pattern doens allow to access the object
# while in contruction.

# the construction steps for differenct types of objects can be stored in director / manager class


# PROS
# ***use the builder patther when a class has a very large constructor
# ***use the builder patter for different representations of a base class
# ***allows to isolate complex code from the business logic

#CONS
# *** this pattern is only justified for large applications due that the complexity of the code increases
