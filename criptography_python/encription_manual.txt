# Double encription 
    ** double level encryption works in the following way
    1) first layer of encryption : 
        A ) the cypher text is generated from the original message using a hash algorythm and a symetric key 
        B) the symetric key is encrypted be an asymetric key .
    
    2) second layer of encryption
        A ) an additional layer of encryption is added with the same or a different algorythm , ususally
        a 32-bit character.

    3) third layer of encryption
        A ) in this process the encrypted capsule(cypher) is transmitted via SSL/TLS conncetion to the commnunication
        patner.


# Hybrid cryptography 
    Is the process of using different cyphesrs of different types  together by including the benefits of each other
