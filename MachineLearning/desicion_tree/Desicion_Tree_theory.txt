Desicion trees are the basic building blocks of some machine learing models
and also the most basic machine learning algorithm. 
** Capturing the data to create our model is called fitting or training the model.
After the modile have been fit we can start making predictions.

--> Our first desicion tree devides houses in two price cathegories based on :

   - the predicted price of any target house (output)
   - the historical average price of many houses in the same cathegory (input)


Example of desicion tree :

    does house have +2 bedrooms
            |
            |
    |-------|-------| yes
    |               |
    |               |
price 178000 €    price 188000 €

**Currenlty our desicion tree has some limitations like for example it only takes
into consideration the number of bedroom. In order to create a model capable of making
more accurate predictions we need to take into considerations more factors like size of the house
in square meters . The more factors or attributes can use our model the better the prediction.

In order to do this our desicion tree needs more divisions:

    does house have +2 bedrooms
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    |
    no----------------------------yes
    |                               |
    |                               | larger than 11500 m^2               
    |                               |
 no |   yes              no-------------------|yes
 -----------             |                    |
|          |             |                    |
|          |             |                    |
|          |             price 170000         price 180000
price 14000 price 188000
